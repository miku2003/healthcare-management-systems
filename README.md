Project Description: The aim of this project is to develop a web-based Patient Management System designed specifically for smaller healthcare clinics. The system will facilitate:

Patient Registration: Easy input and management of patient information.
Appointment Scheduling: Users can schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
Medical Records Management: Secure storage and management of patient medical records.
SMS Notifications: Automated reminders and updates sent to patients using Twilio.
Research and Existing Solutions:

Existing Solutions: Platforms like Epic Systems and Cerner provide comprehensive healthcare management solutions but are tailored for large-scale healthcare organizations.
Challenges:
Complexity: These platforms are too complex for smaller clinics that do not need advanced features.
Cost: High licensing and maintenance costs make these platforms unaffordable for smaller healthcare providers.
Project Goals:

Lightweight and Accessible: Create a user-friendly system that focuses on core functionalities, ensuring simplicity and ease of use for smaller clinics.
Cost-Effective: Develop a system that is affordable to implement and maintain, avoiding unnecessary features that drive up costs.
Enhanced Patient Engagement: Integrate SMS notifications to improve patient communication and reduce no-shows.

Expected Outcomes:

A functional, user-friendly Patient Management System tailored for smaller clinics.
Improved patient engagement through automated SMS notifications.
A cost-effective solution that fills the gap left by more complex and expensive systems.
